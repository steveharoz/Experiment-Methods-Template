## Motivation
Incomplete and ambiguous reporting of experiment methods can make it challenging to understand analyses, interpret results, and critically evaluate conclusions. Furthermore, vaguely described procedures and parameters can be highly frustrating for readers, reviewers, and replicators. Therefore, thoroughly describing methods is a critical component of high quality open science. 

## Goal
This report is a template of information that should appear in a well-described methods section. If any of the information is missing, it limits one’s ability to understand the results. It can act as a checklist for authors before submission, and it can serve as a reference for reviewers to request a revision with more information. 

## Questions

**Who is it for?** This guide is primarily for experiments with visual stimuli – common in fields such as vision science, human factors, human-computer interaction, and data visualization. However, it can likely be adapted for other types of experiments too.

**Is this like Pre-Registration?** A methods section describes what was done (past tense). A pre-registration describes what authors intend to do (future). Many factors can cause experiment plans to change, and aspects like the number of dropped subjects can’t be predicted. So while this report and a pre-registration have much overlap, they are not the same.

**How should this information be presented?** Although narrative prose can be a useful medium for presenting an argument, it can be inefficient and ambiguous for describing experiment methods. When possible, use bulleted lists in a manuscript to clearly convey sets of conditions and parameters, and use numbered lists for sequential procedures. If journal requirements prevent this style of reporting, 

**Are figures necessary?** Example figures are critical for understanding visual stimuli, as text descriptions are often ambiguous or difficult to understand (e.g., “The objects in the outer ring of the target region to the left side of the space after the cue is a different color than the distractors presented in the lower right quadrant of the cue”).

* An example image should be shown for every stimulus condition. 
* Also a diagram of the trial procedure can substantially improve clarity.
